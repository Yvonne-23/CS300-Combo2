1. Project Overview

This project is a two-player domino game written in C++. Each player runs in a separate thread, and both players share the same table and stock of dominoes. 
The program demonstrates multithreading, condition variables, mutex-protected critical sections, and standard OOP design in C++.


2. Implementation Steps

Step 1 — Created the Domino Classes

* Built `CDominoes` to generate all 28 tiles
* Built `CRandom` to shuffle the set
* Made a `CTable` class to keep the played domino line

Step 2 — Implemented Player Logic

* Created a `CPlayer` class
* Added functions to play, draw, or pass
* Added logic to detect when a player wins

Step 3 — Added the Game Controller

* Wrote `main()` to build the set, deal tiles, and create players
* Connected table + stock to both players

Step 4 — Added Multithreading

* Created two threads (one for each player)
* Both threads ran the same function, `playerThread`
* Each one waited for its turn to play

Step 5 — Added Synchronization

* Used one mutex to protect shared resources
* Used condition variables so threads wait for their turn
* Ensured no shared memory race conditions

Step 6 — Final Testing

* Verified alternating turns
* Verified drawing, passing, and game-ending behavior
* Printed final summary


3. Multithreading & Mutex Explanation

Multithreading

* Player 1 runs on Thread 1
* Player 2 runs on Thread 2
* Both share: table, stock, game flags

Mutex / Protected Critical Section

* A global `std::mutex mtx` protects shared data
* Only ONE thread can modify stock/table at a time
* Prevents race conditions

Condition Variables

* `cv_p1` and `cv_p2` make players wait for their turn
* Ensures proper turn-taking


4. GitHub Usage

* Created a repository
* Uploaded all source files
* Commits included: initial design, multithreading, final cleanup
* Final version pushed before submission

5. How to Run the Program
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread "Main (1).cpp" Domino.cpp -o domino.exe
.\domino.exe




6. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates multithreading, mutex-protected shared resources, and a functional domino game implemented using object-oriented C++. 
All required features were achieved, and the program runs correctly.
